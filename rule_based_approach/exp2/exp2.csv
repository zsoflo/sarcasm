11060,train_496,gotta love living in a country where it’s easier to get an AR-15 than it is to get coronavirus testing 😍😝,1,"When I wrote this tweet, COVID testing was really inaccessible. That has somewhat changed but I was really trying to make a comment about how healthcare is a human right and how poorly our country is handling the pandemic. Owning a military-grade weapon isn't really necessary for human life. While I absolutely believe in the right of the working class to arm themselves (although not with an AR-15...), I just think it's ridiculous the barriers that are put up for people when accessing quality healthcare. I think it's run like a business in this country, and it's immoral."
