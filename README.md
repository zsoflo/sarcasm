The file we have to annotate is called : sample_to_annotate_v2\
really important : ** WHEN YOU OPEN THE CSV FILE, IF A WINDOW APPEARS, ASKING YOU HOW YOU WANT YOUR DATA TO BE READ, PAY ATTENTION : IF YOU HAVE CHOICE ABOUT THE SEPARATOR(S) YOU CAN USE, USE THE TABS AND COMMAS BUT NOT THE SEMI-COLONS (NEVER). IF YOUR FILE IS STRANGE (SOME CELLS ARE SPLITTED INTO TWO DIFFERENT COLONS) GO TO THE SETTINGS AND CHANGE THE SEPARATORS AS MENTIONNED BEFORE. **
