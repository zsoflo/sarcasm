# Where to find codes
The codes used to implement several of the methods mentionned in the 2nd report are available in this GitHub repository. Here is a list of all those methods and their location in repository :
* The code used to merged the two datasets (Section 2.3 "Merging datasets") is available here : https://github.com/zsoflo/sarcasm/blob/master/corpus/get_data.ipynb
* The code used to extract the sample of 1000 tweets (Section 3.1 "Sample Extraction") is available here : https://github.com/zsoflo/sarcasm/blob/master/corpus/get_data.ipynb
* The code used to analyze our annotations with respect to the original ones (Section 3.3 "Agreement with the Intended Sarcasm Annotations") is available here : https://github.com/zsoflo/sarcasm/blob/master/annotations/src/annotation_analysis_compare_inital.ipynb
* The code used to measure the IAA between us (Section 3.4 "Inter-Annotator Agreement (IAA)") is available here : https://github.com/zsoflo/sarcasm/blob/master/annotations/src/IAA_krippendorff.ipynb
* The code used for the rule-based approach (Section 4.1 "Classifier architecture" and 4.2 "Experiments") is available here : https://github.com/zsoflo/sarcasm/blob/master/rule_based_approach/exp1.ipynb


# TO US
The file we have to annotate is called : sample_to_annotate_without_duplicates\
really important :  WHEN YOU OPEN THE CSV FILE, IF A WINDOW APPEARS, ASKING YOU HOW YOU WANT YOUR DATA TO BE READ, PAY ATTENTION : IF YOU HAVE CHOICE ABOUT THE SEPARATOR(S) YOU CAN USE, USE THE TABS AND COMMAS BUT NOT THE SEMI-COLONS (NEVER). IF YOUR FILE IS STRANGE (SOME CELLS ARE SPLITTED INTO TWO DIFFERENT COLONS) GO TO THE SETTINGS AND CHANGE THE SEPARATORS AS MENTIONNED BEFORE.
